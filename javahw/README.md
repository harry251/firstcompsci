# Cloning and Running JUnit Tests in Visual Studio Code for the "javahw" Folder

``` bash 
git clone https://github.com/harry251/firstcompsci.git
```

This will clone the entire repository, including the "javahw" folder, to your local machine.

1. In Visual Studio Code, select File > Open Folder and navigate to the location where you cloned the repository.
2. Open the "javahw" folder in Visual Studio Code.
Visual Studio Code will detect that it is a Java project and prompt you to install the necessary extensions. Follow the instructions to install the Java extensions recommended by Visual Studio Code.
3. Once the extensions are installed, open the Java source files located in the "javahw/main" and "javahw/test" folders. You can navigate to the files using the Explorer sidebar in Visual Studio Code.
4. To enable JUnit testing, go to the Testing view in Visual Studio Code by selecting the "Testing" icon on the sidebar.
Click on the "Enable Java Test" button in the top-right corner of the Testing view.
5. From the dropdown menu, select "JUnit" as the testing framework.
6. You should now see the JUnit test cases from the "javahw/test" folder listed in the Testing view.
7. To run the JUnit tests, click on the "Run All" button or select specific tests to run individually.
8. The test results will be displayed in the Testing output window, showing which tests passed and which ones failed.

You are now ready to clone the "javahw" repository and run JUnit tests in Visual Studio Code. Make sure to adapt the repository URL if needed, and follow the instructions provided by Visual Studio Code to enable Java testing. Happy coding!
